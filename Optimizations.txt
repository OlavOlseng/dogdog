Implementing a sorting algorithm that terminates after N individuals have been selected. This can improve the performance of the population culling in ranked mode, as the current and next generation are sorted together.

Culling the population before performing ranking improves the runtime significantly. This needs to be taken into consideration.

The crossover operators can performed without the deep copy calls.
